A `post` will automatically be added to the index.html page in the list of posts.

There are two different post types:

* `writeup` - a regular writeup which is hosted on the page
* `encrypted_writeup` - a writeup which is hosted on a seperate (hard-coded) domain, which is served through a private github repository. This way we avoid leaking writeups for active challenges.

Example for a `writeup`: <_posts/2024-04-13-ctf2024.hackpack.club.md>

Example for an `encrypted_writeup`: <_posts/2024-08-02-hackthebox-artificialUniversity.md>
