[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a beginner CTF provided by the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). It is designed for middle and high school students and is perfect to get you started in the world of CTF. 

This is event part 1 of 3, where you will mainly work on challenges within the "General skills" category. 
Having some sort of Linux system running will help but is not required. Please make sure

Of course you can also just watch and chat.
