### Let's play PicoCTF part 1 (21.04.2021 - 20:00)

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a beginner CTF provided by the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). It is designed for middle and high school students and is perfect to get you started in the world of CTF. 

This is event part 1 of 3, where you will mainly work on challenges within the "General skills" category. This category mostly contains challenges were you have to solve challenges with some common Linux tools. They are a great way to get you started if you never worked with the terminal before.

Having some sort of Linux system running will help but is not required as the PicoCTF site also provides a browser based webshell. Please make sure that you [register an account](https://play.picoctf.org/register) on the PicoCTF website.

Of course you can also just watch and chat. We will meet on 21.04.2021 at 20:00 online on [Discord](https://discord.gg/p5RJTeVA5F).
