### Let's play PicoCTF part 2 (05.05.2021)

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a beginner CTF provided by the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). It is designed for middle and high school students and is perfect to get you started in the world of CTF. 

This event part 2 of 3, where you will mainly work on challenges within the "Web" category. 
Having some sort of Linux system running will help. We will use a tool called BurpSuite (Free Edition), which you
can download and install in advance. Please make sure that you register an account on the PicoCTF website.  

Of course you can also just watch and chat.
