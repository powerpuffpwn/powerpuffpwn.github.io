[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a beginner CTF provided by the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). It is designed for middle and high school students and is perfect to get you started in the world of CTF. 

This is event part 2 of 3, where you will mainly work on challenges within the "Web" category. Security issues in web applications are quite common and a great way to get a basic understanding of common security issues.

Having some sort of Linux system running will help. We will use a free tool called [BurpSuite (Community Edition), which you should download and install in advance](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload). The website also provides Burp versions for Windows/OSX, so feel free to use what you like. Please make sure that you register an account on the PicoCTF website.  

Of course you can also just watch and chat. We will meet on **05.05.2021** at **20:00** online on [Discord](https://discord.gg/p5RJTeVA5F).
