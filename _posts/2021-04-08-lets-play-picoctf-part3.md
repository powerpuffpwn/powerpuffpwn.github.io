### Let's play PicoCTF part 3 (19.05.2021 - 20:00)

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a beginner CTF provided by the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). It is designed for middle and high school students and is perfect to get you started in the world of CTF. 

This is event part 3 of 3, where you will mainly work on challenges within the "Binary Exploitation" and "Reversing" categories. They might require a basic understanding of x86 systems and assembly, but you don't need to be an expert on that. You will probably need some sort of Linux system if you want to work on these challenges. 

Of course you can also just watch and chat. We will meet on 21.04.2021 at 20:00 online on [Discord](https://discord.gg/p5RJTeVA5F).
