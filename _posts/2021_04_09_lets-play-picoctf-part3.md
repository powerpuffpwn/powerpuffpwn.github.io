### Let's play PicoCTF part 3 (19.05.2021)

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a beginner CTF provided by the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). It is designed for middle and high school students and is perfect to get you started in the world of CTF. 

This event part 3 of 3, where you will mainly work on challenges within the "Binary Exploitation" and "Reversing" categories. 
You will probably need some sort of Linux system if you want to work on these challenges. Of course you can also just watch and chat.
